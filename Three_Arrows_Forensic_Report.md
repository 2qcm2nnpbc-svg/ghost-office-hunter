Forensic Risk Report: Three Arrows Capital

1. Adverse Media Check:

- Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a cryptocurrency hedge fund co-founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, experienced a high-profile collapse in mid-2022 amid the crypto market downturn.
- The company filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the United States in July 2022, signaling insolvency and inability to meet financial obligations.
- Multiple media sources reported on liquidity shortages, inability to repay lenders, and bankruptcy filings.
- Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have been subjects of regulatory scrutiny and investigations post-collapse; however, as of now, no publicized arrests or MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) penalties have been formally announced.
- Liquidators have been appointed as part of ongoing bankruptcy proceedings to recover assets.
- Given these adverse developments, including collapse and bankruptcy, Three Arrows Capital is deemed HIGH RISK.

2. Ghost Office Check:

- Three Arrows Capital Singapore was reported to have an address registered at a co-working space or serviced office location in Singapore.
- Using co-working or shared office spaces is a known red flag for potential ghost offices or limited physical presence.
- This supports concerns about the authenticity or robustness of their Singapore entity's operational footprint.

Summary:

Based on the publicly available information, Three Arrows Capital has collapsed, filed for bankruptcy, and is under investigation. Its Singapore address appears to be a co-working/shared office, consistent with characteristics of a ghost office. Given the significant negative news and structural anonymity, Three Arrows Capital represents a HIGH RISK entity from a forensic compliance perspective.
